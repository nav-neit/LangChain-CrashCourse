# LangChain Course: Open-Source LLM Integration

This repository contains adaptations of the LangChain course by [Harish Neel](https://github.com/harishneel1/langchain-course), replacing proprietary models with open-source alternatives to enhance accessibility and learning.

# Key Differences from the Original Course

- **Open-Source Model Integration**: Substituted the proprietary OpenAI models with Meta's LLaMA 3.1, an open-source large language model, accessed via [GroqCloud](https://console.groq.com/docs/langchain).
